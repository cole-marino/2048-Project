Hello! I'm Nicola (Cole) Marino and here is a project that I started as a final for my AP Computer Science A course in High School.
I do plan on cleaning this project up in the future, as well as adding some features such as a self-solving AI.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
    I know that the files are cluttered, for my current coding standards,
    this would be unacceptable.
    It should be noted that this is my first program with such an amount
    of files, and at the time I did not know how to fully manage it
    considering that this was such an early project (being 4 years ago).
